The Idea

A lot of these notes I'd like to add to anki decks

I imagine I'd tag them and then upon adding the tag an operation would occur that would create a new Anki card with specific details on the next day? (the reason next day is so that a full session of notes could be added

possibly be able to update to those cards



requirements

tags that trigger on notes after certain amount of time
anki api
manipulate anki app
